## Unity

    

## Google drive

 
Any formal documentation that is needed in the span of the project is to be written and stored in the team Google Drive such that the documents pertaining to the project are available for all members of the development team. Also by utilizing Google Drive we will have version control of the documents as well and prevent version mismatch within the team.

Google Drive can be found here: [LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1TdxP1vPDAh91ACnegNjZgsC7j2o1mPxj)

## Trello

    

As this project is developed utilizing the agile principles we are going to use Trello as our project management tool.

The Trello board can be found here: [LINK](https://trello.com/b/zSgcKvmL/child-of-now)

Child of now will utilize Trello in order to keep track of the project progress.

## Github


For this project (child of now) we are going to use github exclusively as our repository and version control system (VCS).


## Slack

    
Do to the COVID-19 situation there it is not a and option to be co-located and some members not having the same time zone slack offers an easy way for team members to communicate and members can get all relevant information at their own leisure. Also restricting communication to a team channel also prevents the information from being lost or not communicated to every member of the team as its available for every member of the team.

Slack will also be integrated with every app that the development team uses when available using slack apps. This will allow team members to rapidly get a quick update on what has happened since they last check.


The slack group can be found here: [LINK](https://app.slack.com/client/T018HBC98PL/C018AK9RR7Y)

## Zoom

There will also be a need for “face-to-face” communication, this will be handled using Zoom. This will happen either with the pre-scheduled meetings on Unimelb LMS or posted in Slack.
